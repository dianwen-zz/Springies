**Note: This project is not representative of my current design knowledge, as it is one of my first projects**

This project is a mass/spring/environmental force simulator using the JBox2D physics engine and the JGame game engine.

Two file choosers will initially appear. First, load an environment XML file. Then, load an assembly XML file to draw and animate an assembly. Press 'n' in the simulation to load another file, and press 'c' to clear all assemblies.


Press the keys displayed in the animation to toggle individual forces:
* 'G' - Gravity
* 'V' - Viscosity
* 'M' - Center of mass
* '1' - Wall repulsion from top wall
* '2' - Wall repulsion from left wall
* '3' - Wall repulsion from bottom wall
* '4' - Wall repulsion from right wall
* 'UP' - Move wall boundaries inwards
* 'DOWN' - Move wall boundaries outwards
* '-' - Decrease all muscles' amplitudes
* '=' - Increase all muscles' amplitudes
